# Web Development Project 5 - _NASA APOD Explorer_ ü™ê

Submitted by: **Houlaymatou B.**

This web app: **A dashboard application that lets users explore NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day archive, save favorites, rate images, and filter content through an advanced dashboard interface.**

## Required Features ‚ú®

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard displays favorite astronomical images and videos, one per row
  - Each row includes image thumbnail, title, author, date, media type, and rating
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
  - Used for API calls to NASA's APOD service and for localStorage persistence
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data**
  - Total number of favorite images
  - Average rating across all favorites
  - Distribution of media types (images vs videos)
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar correctly filters by author name or date
  - Results update dynamically as users type in the search field
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - Filters include author, rating, and media type
  - Each filter correctly restricts the displayed items
  - The dashboard updates immediately as filters are applied

The following **optional** features are implemented üöÄ:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
  - Search, author filter, rating filter, and media type filter work together
- [x] Filters use different input types
  - Text input for search
  - Dropdown selections for author, rating, and media type
- [x] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values
  - Rating filter allows selecting minimum rating threshold (3+, 4+, or 5 hearts)

The following **additional** features are implemented üéâ:

- [x] Local storage persistence to save user preferences between sessions
- [x] Rating system that allows users to rate images with 3-5 hearts

## Notes üìù

Challenges encountered while building the app:

- Managing multiple state variables across different components
- Implementing proper filtering logic that could handle all filter combinations
- Optimizing performance with useMemo for filtered data
- Managing responsive design for both the explorer and dashboard views
- Handling cases where the NASA API returned incomplete data (missing copyright/author information)
